A statically typed [dimensional analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis) calculator written in [Agda](http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php). Contains 7 base dimensions: Mass (M), length (L), time (T), electrical current (I), absolute temperature (Θ), amount of substance (N) and luminous intensity (J), as well as some derived SI units.

Used to prove that the equation e=mc² is indeed measured in joules.

Similar to [Dimensional](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/dimensional) and [Dimenso](http://dimenso.sourceforge.net/), although just a toy and probably will stay that way.

~~Hyperlinked, syntax-colored, html version of the file is located at StaticDimensions.html for ease of viewing. Just download and view in your favorite browser. (Hopefully github will get syntax highlighting for Agda soon. :D)~~ Ahahaha! Github, you rock!
